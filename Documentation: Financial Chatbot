Summary:
The Financial Chatbot is a simple Python-based command-line application designed to provide financial information for three major companies: Apple, Microsoft, and Tesla. Users can interact with the chatbot by selecting a company and then choosing from a list of predefined financial queries. The chatbot responds with specific information based on the latest fiscal year data.
How the Chatbot Works:

1. Startup:
i) The user is greeted with a welcome message.
ii) The user is prompted to select one of three companies: Apple, Microsoft, or Tesla.

2. Query Selection:
i) After selecting a company, the user is presented with a list of predefined financial queries.
ii) The user selects a query by entering the corresponding number.

3. Response:
i) The chatbot processes the query and provides a canned response based on the selected company and query.

4. Additional Queries:
i) The user is prompted to ask another question or exit the chatbot.
ii) If the user chooses to ask another question, the process repeats; otherwise, the session ends with a goodbye message.

Predefined Queries:
* The chatbot can respond to the following predefined queries:
1. What is the total revenue for the latest fiscal year?
2. How has net income changed over the last year?
3. What are the total assets as of the latest fiscal year?
4. Can you compare the total liabilities for the latest fiscal year?
5. What is the year-over-year change in revenue?
6. How has cash flow from operating activities changed over the past three years?
7. What is the net income for the past three fiscal years?
8. Can you show the trend of total revenue over the last three years?
9. What is the percentage change in total assets from the previous year?
10. How does the total liabilities compare to others for the latest fiscal year?

Limitations:
1. Limited Scope: The chatbot can only provide information on Apple, Microsoft, and Tesla for a limited set of predefined queries.
2. Static Data: The responses are based on a static dataset from the latest fiscal year and do not update dynamically.
3. No Natural Language Processing: The chatbot does not process natural language queries; users must choose from a predefined list of queries.
4. Limited Interaction: The chatbot interaction is linear and limited to the command line, lacking more advanced conversational features.

Conclusion:
The Financial Chatbot is a useful tool for quickly obtaining specific financial information about Apple, Microsoft, and Tesla. While it has limitations in scope and interaction, it serves as a foundation for building more complex and dynamic financial chatbots in the future.
